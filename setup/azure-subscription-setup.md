# Azure Subscription Setup

## Overview
This guide provides instructions on setting up an **Azure Subscription** to deploy virtual machines and configure a honeypot.

## Step 1: Create an Azure Subscription
1. Visit the [Azure Free Account page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account).
2. Sign up using your Microsoft account and follow the prompts.
3. If eligible, select the **free tier** to receive limited free credits.
4. If the free tier is unavailable, consider:
   - Creating a paid subscription (ensure you **monitor usage** to avoid unexpected charges).
   - Joining the **Cyber Range** for an affordable flat-rate Azure environment ([Cyber Range](https://skool.com/cyber-range)).

## Step 2: Access Azure Portal
Once the subscription is created, log in at:
- [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)

## Next Steps
Now that your Azure subscription is set up, proceed to deploying the honeypot by setting up a Virtual Machine: [Honeypot VM Setup](honeypot-vm-setup.md).

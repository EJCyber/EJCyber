I‚Äôm a **cybersecurity professional** with experience in **technical support, SOC analysis, and Microsoft 365 administration**. Passionate about **threat detection, incident response, and continuous learning** in the cybersecurity space.

## üéØ Objective  
With a strong foundation in IT and technical support, I am actively transitioning into a **Security Operations Center (SOC) role as a Tier 1 Analyst**. Through hands-on labs and certifications, I have developed skills in **threat detection, incident response, and security monitoring**, which I am eager to apply in a professional SOC environment.

# Home SOC Lab ‚Äì Azure Honeypot & Threat Monitoring

## üîç Overview
This project simulates a **Security Operations Center (SOC)** environment by deploying a honeypot in **Microsoft Azure** to monitor and analyze real-world cyber threats. The goal is to enhance **threat detection skills** by collecting, analyzing, and visualizing malicious activities using **Log Analytics, Microsoft Sentinel, and Kusto Query Language (KQL).**

## üîß Tools & Technologies Used
- **Microsoft Azure** ‚Äì Virtual Machine (VM) deployment & cloud security monitoring
- **Microsoft Sentinel** ‚Äì SIEM for real-time monitoring & threat analysis
- **Log Analytics** ‚Äì Event data collection & aggregation
- **Kusto Query Language (KQL)** ‚Äì Custom threat querying & data analysis
- **Attack Mapping** ‚Äì Mapping & analyzing attack patterns to understand adversary tactics

## üõ† Project Workflow
This lab follows a structured approach to deploy a honeypot, collect security logs, analyze threats, and map attack behaviors.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Deploying the Honeypot
- Created a **Windows/Linux VM** in Azure and exposed select services to attract malicious traffic.
- Configured firewall and network settings to simulate a vulnerable system.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Log Collection & Aggregation
- Captured incoming attacks and logged activity via **Azure Log Analytics**.
- Forwarded logs to **Microsoft Sentinel** for centralized monitoring.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Threat Analysis Using KQL
- Queried **Log Analytics Workspace** to extract attack patterns.
- Filtered and visualized attack sources, methods, and timestamps.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Building an Attack Map
- Mapped out attack patterns to understand adversary behavior.
- Documented findings and security recommendations.

## üìå Key Findings
‚úÖ Identified multiple brute-force login attempts and network scanning activities.  
‚úÖ Detected suspicious IPs and their geographical locations.  
‚úÖ Analyzed attacker dwell time and attack vectors.  

Through this lab, I identified real-world attack trends, strengthening my threat detection and analysis skills.

## üîú Next Steps & Expansion
- Integrating **Elastic Stack (ELK)** for enhanced log visualization.  
- Implementing **automated alerting** for real-time threat detection.  
- Expanding honeypot capabilities to monitor **different types of cyberattacks**.  

I am currently testing ELK integration and plan to implement automated alerting soon.

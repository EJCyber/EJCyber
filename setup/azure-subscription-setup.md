# Get Started with a Free Azure Subscription

## Overview
This guide will help you set up a **free Microsoft Azure subscription** to deploy a SOC lab while avoiding unnecessary costs.

## Step 1: Create a Free Azure Account
1. Go to the [Microsoft Azure Free Tier](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).
2. Click **Start for Free** and sign in with a Microsoft account.
3. Complete the registration process, including identity verification (a credit card is required for verification only â€“ no charges will be made).
4. Once registered, log in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).

### ðŸ’¡ **Whatâ€™s Included in the Free Tier**
- **$200 in Azure credits** (valid for the first 30 days).
- **12 months of free services**, including virtual machines, storage, and networking.
- **Always Free Services**, such as **Azure Log Analytics**, which will be used in this project.

## Step 2: Prevent Unexpected Charges
To ensure that your lab remains cost-free, follow these precautions:
- **Enable a spending limit**: Azure will automatically pause services if you exceed the free tier.
- **Monitor usage**: Check your Azure Cost Management dashboard regularly.
- **Shut down or delete resources**: Turn off virtual machines when theyâ€™re not in use to avoid unnecessary usage of free-tier limits.

## Step 3: Next Steps â€“ Setting Up the Honeypot VM
With your free subscription ready, proceed to the next step: [Honeypot VM Setup](honeypot-vm-setup.md).

# Attack Map Creation in Microsoft Sentinel

## Overview
This guide explains how to create an **Attack Map** in **Microsoft Sentinel** using workbooks to visualize attack patterns based on geo-location data.

## Prerequisites
- **Log Analytics and Sentinel Setup Completed** [Log Forwarding & KQL Queries](SecurityProjects/setup/log-forward-kql.md)
- **Geo-location data enrichment implemented** [Log Enrichment with Location Data](setup/log-enrichment-location-data.md)

## Steps

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Open Microsoft Sentinel Workbooks
1. Navigate to **Microsoft Sentinel** in the **Azure Portal**.
2. Select your **Log Analytics Workspace**.
3. Under **Threat Management**, click **Workbooks**.
4. Click **+ New** to create a new workbook.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Add a Query-Based Visualization
1.Click **Edit**, then Click the **...** on the right side to remove the default visuals.

2. Click **Add**, then **Add Query**![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ab0c733-20bd-46fe-bb0e-cf9f02cd6c74)

3. Select **Log Analytics** as the data source.
4. Use the following **KQL Query** to retrieve attack locations:

   ```kql
   SecurityEvent
   | where EventID == 4625  // Failed login attempts
   | extend AttackerIP = IpAddress
   | lookup GeoLocation on AttackerIP
   | project TimeGenerated, AttackerIP, Country, Latitude, Longitude
   ```

4. Click **Run** to preview the data.
5. Click **Visualization** and select **Map**.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Customize the Attack Map
1. Set **Latitude** and **Longitude** as location fields.
2. Use **Country** as the display label.
3. Adjust visualization settings to enhance readability.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Save and Deploy
1. Click **Save** and enter a meaningful name like `Attack Map Workbook`.
2. Click **Done Editing**.
3. The attack map should now display failed login attempts and their locations.

## Next Steps
‚úÖ Enhance visualization with additional filters (e.g., specific time ranges).
‚úÖ Set up alerts based on unusual geo-location patterns.
‚úÖ Review attack trends regularly in **Microsoft Sentinel**.

üöÄ You have now successfully built a **real-time attack map** in **Microsoft Sentinel**!
